# Entity/Relationship Model

Practical Case - Database Design

## Objective

- Create an Entity/Relationship design that identifies entities and their relationships.
- Additionally, it can indicate the attributes of these entities.

## Information

It is desired to have a database with information about facilities/buildings.
- Information about floors: name, category, description, GUID (Global Unique Identifier), height.
- About spaces: name, category, description, usable height, area, GUID.
- Components: name, description, GUID, serial number, installation date.
- Component types: name, description, model, GUID, material, color, warranty years.

### FACILITIES
- id
- guid
- name
- description
- category
- address

### FLOORS
- id
- guid
- name
- category
- description
- height
- facilityId

### SPACES
- id
- guid
- name
- category
- description
- usableHeight
- area
- floorId

### COMPONENTS
- id
- guid
- name
- description
- serialNumber
- installedOn
- spaceId
- typeId

### TYPES
- id
- guid
- name
- description
- modelNumber
- color
- warrantyYears

Additionally, the following constraints are indicated:
- The GUIDs must be unique.
- It is not possible to register a component without a type.
- It is not possible to register a space without a floor.
- It is not possible to register a floor without a facility.
- Two components cannot have the same name, the same applies to the rest of the entities.
- The installation date of a component by default is the current date.
- Names cannot be empty in all entities.
- Warranty years cannot be zero or negative.
- Referential integrity must be maintained.

> In a real environment, it is necessary to elucidate and clarify what the client needs.
