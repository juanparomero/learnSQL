SQL examples using Oracle as the database management system. Although for some exercises you have to consider the RDBMS, they can still be implemented in other database management systems. The necessary software to work can be downloaded from the official Oracle website, such as Oracle Express Edition (the lightest database manager, sufficient for practicing) and Oracle SQLDeveloper (working environment if you prefer not to use the terminal).
